### Copies a list of files, from `deploy_files.csv`, to their appropriate
### locations.
###
### See `deploy_files.csv` to see what files are being copied.
###
### Requires root permissions to function properly.

### Copies a file to a specified directory.
###
### [$1] is the file name in the repo, [$2] the new file name and [$3] the
### folder name/location(will be newly made if non-existent).
###
### The files to be copied are present in the `./files/` directory.
###
### If the specified file already exists, then `cp` prompts for user input
### regarding whether the file should be overidden or not.
copy_file() {
  ### If the file already exists, provide a diff
  if [ -e "$3/$2" ]; then
    diff -us --color "$3/$2" "./files/$1"
    printf "\nOverwrite %s/%s? (y/Y for yes)\t" "$3" "$2"
    read -r overwrite < /dev/tty
    echo "$overwrite" | grep -q 'y\|Y' || return
    ### Create a backup of the old file before copying
    cp -rT "$3/$2" "$3/$2.old" && echo "[INFO] Old $3/$2 copied to $3/$2.old." && \
      bak_created=0
  fi
  [ -z "$bak_created" ] && bak_created=1
  mkdir -pv "$3"
  cp -vrT "./files/$1" "$3/$2"
}

### Between two paths of equal or unequal length, removes the longest matching
### common path and provides the root folder of the resulting location.
###
### ```sh
### $ x="/home/anurag"; y="/home/anurag/some_folder"
### $ echo "${x#$y/}" ('/' is added to remove the leading character)
### /home/anurag (no match for "/home/anurag/some_folder" in "/home/anurag")
### $ echo "${y#$x/}"
### some_folder
### ```
###
### The function additionally cuts and returns the first field which would be
### the root of the non-matching location.
non_matching_path_root() {
  full_path="$2"
  remove_path="$1"
  echo "${full_path#$remove_path/}" | cut -d '/' -f1
}

### In case the user uses the `.profile` and `.rootprofile` file as-is, reminds
### them to create the bash history folder.
make_bash_history() {
  cat << END

In case you haven't changed the "HISTFILE" value in ".profile" and ".rootprofile"
and copied those files to your system, run:

	mkdir -pv ~/.local/share/bash
	sudo mkdir -pv /root/.local/share/bash

for bash to create the history file at the new location.
